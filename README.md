# frontend-framework-from-scratch

I recommend first having a look at [the PDF learning report](https://github.com/petercrona/o2fp/raw/main/report.pdf).

## Run

1. Clone the repo
2. cd frontend-framework-from-scratch
2. npm i
3. npm run watch
4. open new terminal
5. cd frontend-framework-from-scratch 
6. npx serve -s
7. Enjoy at localhost:3000

## o2fp

If you want to try just the framework, it was extracted out in https://github.com/petercrona/o2fp and published on npm as "o2fp". So you can do "npm install o2fp" in your TypeScript projected.
